      <h2>Distributed Version Control System</h2>
      <p>Imagine working on your application. You might have a project that’s developing the next release, one for ongoing day to day maintenance, one for a minor enhancement, a few bug fixes happening, and one for a new feature being added to the
        existing version.</p>
      <p>That’s ok as long as the programs you are changing don’t overlap much. Wait, we said new release work is being done. Unless you are renaming everything you work on, I think there might be a lot of overlap in that project.</p>
      <p>In the scenario above, pessimistic checkout can work, but in the end, you’ll feel like a trained poodle after all the hoops you’ll need to jump through. If you enjoy being a trained poodle, you can stop reading here, if you’d like to hear
        about a better way? follow me &darr;.</p>
